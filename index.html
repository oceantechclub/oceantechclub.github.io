At Ocean Tech Club, you are a private member for the evening.

Be cool, but warm.

There is an unwritten rule that you can arrive as early as 5pm for handmade margaritas and a more intimate hangout.

Official time starts at 6pm and ends at 8pm. Want to continue the evening? We recommend walking to nearby Vito's. Our friend JJ will take care of you at the bar. You can never go wrong there. Nearby El Torito also has an underappreciated bar. Easy spot with new friends. Choose your after vibe.
