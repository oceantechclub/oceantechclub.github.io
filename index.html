<br/>

At Ocean Tech Club, you are a private member for the evening.
<br/>
<br/>

Be cool, but warm.
<br/>
<br/>

There is an unwritten rule that you can arrive as early as 5pm for handmade margaritas and a more intimate hangout.
<br/>
<br/>

Official time starts at 6pm and ends at 8pm. Want to continue the evening? We recommend walking to nearby Vito's. Our friend JJ will take care of you at the bar. You can never go wrong there. Nearby El Torito also has an underappreciated bar. Easy spot with new friends. Choose your vibe.
<br/>
<br/>

OTC is:
<br/>
Exclusive, yet welcoming.
<br/>
At ease, yet sophisticated.
<br/>
Casual, yet intellectual.
<br/>
<br/>

Dress code:
<br/>
Suit is too much unless you want to pull it off. Style will be appreciated. Generally a good rule of thumb is dress like you would if riding in a late 90s BMW E36 convertible on your way to a friend's kickback in the hills. Casual but clean.
<br/>
<br/>

Photography:
<br/>
Photography is generally not allowed. If taking photographs, make it anonymous. No photos of others shared on social media. Do a close up shot of a drink or something along those lines. Something style-ized. Be creative. If posting do not tag location or as Ocean Tech Club or as a Local event. Also do not tag people's handles. You may reshare someone's share. You may also tag as OTC. These rules do not apply to analog photography which is completely allowed. Get people's instas or numbers to share with them after you develop the film.
<br/>
<br/>
Music:
<br/>
Music will be different each club. May 16th we'll be playing sounds from Internet Leisure Company, Poolsuite FM.
<br/>
<br/>
Pets:
<br/>
No pets allowed, excepting seeing eye dogs. No emotional support animals allowed.
<br/>
<br/>
Other Etiquette:
<br/>
Social over Commercial
<br/>
Culture over Current Events
<br/>
<br/>
While there is value in the items on the right, we value items on the left more.
<br/>
<br/>
Generally, you can bring 1 guest.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OTC is a community of other ambitious individuals in tech, with similar goals and lifestyles. Have casual, yet intellectual conversations in a backyard atmosphere. Form lasting relationships and maintain contact with the people you meet, and leave each event with new memories, inspiration, and relationships.
<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the club.
